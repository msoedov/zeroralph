# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-29
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `/ralf` in .gitignore (not `ralf`) to avoid ignoring cmd/ralf/ directory
- Global ~/.gitignore ignores prd.json, CLAUDE.md, progress.txt - use `git add -f` to force add them
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-003
- What was implemented: PRD loading and validation with error handling
- Files changed: prd.json (marked complete - implementation was already in place)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - loadPRD() loads from script directory (executable location, not cwd)
  - getScriptDir() uses os.Executable() to find binary location
  - Graceful error handling for missing file and invalid JSON
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-002
- What was implemented: CLI argument parsing with --tool, --help, --version, and positional max_iterations
- Files changed: prd.json (marked complete - implementation was already in place from US-001)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - parseArgs() handles --tool flag with validation (amp|claude)
  - Positional numeric args are parsed as max_iterations
  - printUsage() provides comprehensive help text
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-001
- What was implemented: Go project structure with CLI entry point
- Files changed: go.mod, cmd/ralf/main.go, .gitignore, CLAUDE.md, prd.json, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project already had substantial implementation in main.go (arg parsing, PRD loading, progress file init, archiving)
  - Build with: `go build -o ralf ./cmd/ralf/`
  - Test with: `./ralf --version` and `./ralf --help`
